JETRON - Jet Tree Regression with Optimal LundNet

## About
This acronym combines "Jet," which relates to the physics aspect of your project, and "Tree" to emphasize the tree structure of the jet data. "Regression with Optimal LundNet" highlights the specific task your model aims to perform - learning the features of the nodes using the LundNet variables.

## Install jetron
jetron is tested and supported on 64-bit systems running Linux.

Install jetron with Python's pip package manager:

```
git clone git@github.com:GiorgioCerro/jetron.git
cd jetron
pip install -e .
```
