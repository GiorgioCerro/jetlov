JETLOV - Enhancing Jet Tree Tagging through Neural Network Learning of Optimal LundNet Variables

## About
This acronym combines "Jet," which relates to the physics aspect of the project, and "LOV" can be seen as an abbreviation for "LundNet Optimal Variables." These variables are learned or optimized within your model, and they play a central role in your research.

## Install jetlov
jetlov is tested and supported on 64-bit systems running Linux.

Install jetron with Python's pip package manager:

```
git clone git@github.com:GiorgioCerro/jetron.git
cd jetlov
pip install -e .
```

## Input data

All data used for the final models can be downloaded from the git-lfs repository
at https://github.com/JetsGame/data.
